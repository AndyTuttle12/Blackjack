## Overview

---

## Technologies

Made with: 
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- HTML/CSS

---

## Dependencies

None, just simple front-end logic and css trickery!

---

## MVP

Starting this project, I built a simple game that had rules and a win condition. Going from there, my next set of goals included:
- a visual representation of the table
- a simple animation for dealing cards
- an interactive betting area

**Currently in progress:**
- a full betting system with minimums, splits, double downs and a bank
- updated visual and interactive chips
