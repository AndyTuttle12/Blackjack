## Overview

This project started out as a simple game to demonstrate jQuery DOM manipulation and add some CSS classes dynamically. That quickly became a reality, and after making the basic app work with the rules of a simple blackjack game, I added more and more features! The first goal was to make sure all the logic for the gameplay worked for every edge case, and then to style the game to look like a real blackjack table with dealing animations, shuffling, and 3D perspective. 

For each win or loss, I created different messages and outcomes based on the standard rules of casino blackjack, and incorporated a drag and drop system with jQuery UI to create a fully interactive betting area. Then, after many tweaks to the visual aspect of the betting area, I added fully interactive chips, bet resets, and custom betting options. 

The final update added new features to the game adding quite a bit of complexity, and real Vegas inspired gameplay:

- I added logic to double down after the initial deal,
- a fully integrated bank system where every bet action affects the player's total, 
- the ability to purchase insurance on the deal if the dealer has an Ace showing,
- and finally, a very complex system of second side pots and a whole new had specifically for the option to split a deal of two cards of the same value.

## MVP

Starting this project, I built a simple game that had rules and a win condition. Going from there, my next set of goals included:
- a visual representation of the table
- a simple animation for dealing cards
- an interactive betting area

Recently, I completed more of the features that were reserved as stretch goals:
- a full betting system with minimums, splits, insurance, double downs and a bank
- updated visual and interactive chips
